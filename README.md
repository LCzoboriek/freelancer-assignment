# README

Ive created the full app for the code test, i did struggle to add the feature of the first non filtered page only making a single database request per day, im not entirely sure how to do that, i did try to add it, if you check the other branch (trying-out-cache) on this repository you can see me trying to use cache and fetch, but then i realised it broke another feature of showing and displaying the freelancer. I was also advised it wasnt best practice to do it this way, and would be better to stick to the methods that pagy uses for example. Its something i'd need some support in i believe in learning. So i decided not to merge this branch due to this problem occuring.

I've learnt quite a fair bit working on rails for this web app, and have to say i see why people use it, its so fast for creating things! Compared to the COBOL world i work in at the moment where
compiles and rebuilds can take weeks!
So i do appreciate the time and experience in this application. 

If you need any instructions on how to run this app, just ask and i'll try my best to answer, im sure that you'll mostly be looking at the code however :)
