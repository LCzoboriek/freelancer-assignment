# README

Ive created the full app for the code test, i did struggle to add the feature of the first non filtered page only making a single database request per day, im not entirely sure how to do that
and couldnt find any documentation on how to implement this on my app, i hope this doesn't dishearten you though.

I've learnt quite a fair bit working on rails for this web app, and have to say i see why people use it, its so fast for creating things! Compared to the COBOL world i work in at the moment where
compiles and rebuilds can take weeks!
So i do appreciate the time and experience in this application. 

If you need any instructions on how to run this app, just ask and i'll try my best to answer, im sure that you'll mostly be looking at the code however :)
